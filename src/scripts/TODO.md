# High prio

- visualize the semantic segmentation input of the classifier
  - they might be useless when pixels are removed from the image
  - they might be useless basically all the time, even... hope it works properly
- implement RGB-only version of SASceneNet
  - it is officially supported but the code is missing from my repo
- when using inpainted baselines, skip examples where no objects were found

# Medium prio
- write tests to check determinism
- visualize the whole pipeline to detect any bugs that might exist

# Low prio
None
